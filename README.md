# TODO-Application
This is a ExpressJS application to help you store your To-Do tasks.
This has basic features for: 

## Prerequisites
You will need to below dependencies for running this application: 
1. [install node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

#### Install dependencies

To install all dependencies run the following command:
```
npm install
```

#### Create the .env file from .env.example
You would need to create a .env file for the application to run. 
You can directly copy the values from .env.example to a new .env file. 

#### Starting application

Finally you can start the TODO applocation server:

```
npm run start
```
This would be running based on docker-compose. So please install the docker-compose before running this.
This would take some time, since it would build the relevant dockers and start the application. 

This application is based on ExpressJS.

Or you can [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/ce93b0ae3b8ebbae89aa)

The export is also provided in the [repository](TODO-Application.postman_collection.json)

Currently the "Authorization" Token has been set in .env.example to 8xjM8PF9XC7KVUQ. 
So you would need to pass this as a header:
```
{"Authorization": "8xjM8PF9XC7KVUQ"}
```

#### Running Tests
You can run the tests with command: 
```
npm run test
```

You can also see the test coverage using: 
```
npm run test:coverage
```
I have tried to write tests to cover the Logical parts.
